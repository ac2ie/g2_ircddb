g2_ircddb
=========

This package is for making a ircddb gateway based on Scott Lawson KI4LKF g2_ircddb gateway software.

The only repeater device supported so far is a DVAP dongle (see http://www.dvapdongle.com). Plans are
to also support a GMSK modem (as soon as I can get my hands on one).

As configures, this software requires a Debian or Debian-based Linux OS and is specifically designed
for a Raspberry Pi (http://raspberrypi.org) on Raspbian Liunx or a BeagleBone Black
(http://beagleboard.org) running Debian Linux.

Building this package is easy. You clone this repository, execute a few commands, edit a few files and
then insall it. Reboot and you are ready to go. For much more details, see BUILDING and CONFIGURING.
