QnetGateway
===========

The QnetGateway is an D-Star IRCDDB gateway application that supports MMDVMHost (and all of its supported repeater modems) as well as the DVAP Dongle and the DVRPTR_V1. It is *incredibly easy* to build and install the system.

For building a QnetGateway + MMDVMHost system, see the MMDVM.README file. For a QnetGateway for a DVAP or DVRPTR, see the BUILDING file.


For details of interesting things QnetGatway can do, see the CONFIGURING file. For example, with QnetGateway, you can execute up to 36 different Linux scripts from you radio. Two scripts are include:

```
YourField = _ _ _ _ _ _ H X   will halt your system.
YourField = _ _ _ _ _ _ R X   will reboot your system.
```
