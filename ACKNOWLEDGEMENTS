g2_ircddb was original written by Scott Lawson, KI4LKF. Many of Scott's original comments are contained in the this
package.

g2_ircddb uses IRCDDB software written by Michael Dirska, DL1BFF. Both Scott and Michael published their code under
version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Since I have substantially modified both source streams, I have largely
removed their original copyright statements in source code and and have acknowledged their contribution to this
current project here. The current form of g2_ircddb would be completely impossible without Scott and Michael's
contribution. Thank you for a great starting point of this current project!

g2_ircddb continues to be published under Version 2 of the GNU General Public License, see the LICENSE file.
