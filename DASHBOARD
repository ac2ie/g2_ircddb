     ##### DASH #####

The first iteration of the dash is very rudimentary, but it provides the
following information, refreshed every 30s:

* Node Callsign
* Node TX Frequency
* Node IP Address
* Currently Linked Reflector

To access the dashboard, simply point a browser at the Hotspot's IP address or
at http://<hostname>.local/ (on the same subnet).


To install, run the following command after the main installation:

  sudo make installdash

Note that this will install the PIP package for Python3 if not installed, and
it will also install the libconf Python module. These are not uninstalled by the
uninstall script, but as these are idempotent commands, there is no issue running
the install if they are already present.


To uninstall, run the following:

  sudo make uninstalldash
