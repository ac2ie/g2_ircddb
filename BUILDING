Creating a DVAP hotspot based on Scott Lawson KI4LKF software is easy.

I highly recommend doing this with Debian on a Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone Black, but it should
also work on virtually an hardware platform with any Debian-based OS. UBUNTU should work, but
make no guarantees!

The first order of business is to get the RasPi or the BBB up and running on a Debian image.
There is plenty of room on the interal 2GB memory of the BBB to install all of what follows.
(Unless you need a GUI, it that case you will need a lot more packages than I list below and
a big enough external uSD card to hold the image.)

Look to http://raspberrypi.org for the RasPi Raspbian hard float image and to
http://www.armhf.com for the BBB Debian image.

The RasPi should have all the needed packages but the BBB will not.
On the BBB you will have:
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
agt-get install make g++ unzip

and maybe a few more.

The first order of business (after you expand the archvive this file came in) is to build the
wxBase-2.8.12 library. There is a script to do all of this for you called "build_wsBase",
but if you want to do this by hand, cat this script and type the command manually.

Come back to this directory and type "make" to build all the executables. If you need DTMFS
then also "build g2link_test".

Now you should edit all the *.cfg files, g2_ircddb.cfg, g2_link.cfg and dvap_rptr.cfg.
These files contain detailed comments. Just read through them and edit accordingly.
Additional information about the configuration as well as other important and useful
features are also in the CONFIGURING file.

The gwys.txt file is the internet address and port numbers for any gateway you would
like g2_link to be able to connect to. The one delivered with this package is special:
It has only XReflectors and DStar reflectors and the XReflectors are configures
with the 20001 port. This will allow you to connect to everybody without opening any
ports on your router. If you want to set up a repeater or access point, you will need
to port forward several ports to your RasPi or BBB. Of course you will need to lock
down the local address of the device with a static IP or reserving an address from
your router. Executing get_gwys_list.sh will download a HUGE list of reflectors and
repeaters with port address that my need forwarding to your sytem.

If you plan on using DTMFS, you can also edit proc_g2_ircddb_dtmfs.sh to add new dtmfs
commands.

Then install everything by typing "sudo make install". If you want DTMFS, type
"sudo make installdtmfs".

Everything will install in /usr/local. The executables will be in /usr/local/bin and
the *.cfg files will be in /usr/local/etc. If you need to modify a configuration file,
do it in /usr/local/etc.

At this point, you can either reboot to start the three or four services, or start them
manually with the "service" command. (See the man page for service.)

You can clean up the intermediate *.o files with "make clean" and remove the intermediate
*.o files and binary executables with "make realclean".

If you want to uninstall everything return to the build directory and type
"sudo make uninstall" and possibly "sudo make uninstalldtmfs". This will shutdown the
service scripts, remove everything from /usr/local and remove the service scripts.
